quite as good,0
same price,0
grand luxe,0
great place to meet,0
my out of town friends,0

and worth it,0
people around us,0
everyone was very,0

his burger was,0
plenty of street parking,0
the crispy shrimp,0
yet to,0
words to describe,0
the plate was the,0
an open mind,0
and coke,0
did not stand out,0
very strong,0
a long walk,0
they ran,0
from the east,0
view of the strip,0
and the service is,0
fire the,0
knowledgeable on the,0
and had plenty of,0
to wait minutes to,0
a deep fried,0
restaurant for our,0
we were still hungry,0
wait for minutes,0
we then shared,0
think twice about,0
too much cheese and,0
