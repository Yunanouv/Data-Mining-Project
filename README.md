# Data-Mining-Project
This is an *on-going* data mining project from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign from Coursera using [Yelp Dataset]()

## Overview
The goal of the Data Mining Project is to provide you an opportunity to synthesize the knowledge and skills you’ve learned from previous courses and apply them to solve real-world data mining challenges. You will work on a restaurant review data set from Yelp and mine this data set to discover interesting and useful knowledge to help people make dining decisions, including constructing a cuisine map to help people understand the landscape of different cuisines, mining popular dishes of a given cuisine, recommending (i.e., ranking) restaurants for a given dish, and predicting hygiene of a restaurant.

There will be a set of mining tasks that you must finish. Each task is, in nature, similar to a programming assignment with experiments on a data set, though the actual amount of programming needed may vary since sometimes you might be using existing implementations of algorithms rather than writing your own implementation. The specification of each task is sufficiently general to provide flexibility for you to explore your own ideas, but we also provide a minimum requirement that is specific enough to allow you to easily finish each task.

The submission you need to generate for each task is generally a brief report documenting what you’ve done with some justification and explanation. At the end of the course, you will be asked to write a consolidated project report to summarize all your activities and present all your results. 


### Task 1 
1. Use a topic model (e.g., PLSA or LDA) to extract topics from all the review text (or a large sample of them) and visualize the topics to understand what people have talked about in these reviews.  
2. Do the same for two subsets of reviews that are interesting to compare (e.g., positive vs. negative reviews for a particular cuisine or restaurant), and visually compare the topics extracted from the two subsets to help understand the similarity and differences between these topics extracted from the two subsets. You can form these two subsets in any way that you think is interesting. Here we show a sample visualization for a sample of reviews with high and low ratings.

This is the visualization of what people have talked about in restaurant reviews using LDA.
